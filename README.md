# File Transfer System

- First, run `server.py` on the server machine.
- Transferred files will be stored in the "Download" folder.
- If the client closes or logs out, the repository will be removed.
- When publishing a file, make sure to include a postfix in its name. For example, use `abc.txt` or `abc.jpg`. This action prevents other clients from being unable to read it (by default, they can't identify the file).
